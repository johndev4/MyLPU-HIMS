            <p class="text-justify">We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy
                policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide
                (“Personal Information”) on the <a href="<?= site_url() ?>" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000">www.mylpuhims.com</a> website (“Website” or “Service”) and
                any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining,
                protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of
                your Personal Information and how you can access and update it.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website
                operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other
                legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms
                “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the
                terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. By
                accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
                the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to
                individuals that we do not employ or manage. </p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-2">Collection of personal information</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">You can access and use the Website and Services by logging in your credentials given by the ICT
                Department. We will be able to identify necessary personal information about you to ensure smooth transaction of
                services. </p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-3">Use and processing of collected information</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have
                entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data
                processor.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act
                in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your
                access and use of the Website and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes
                and means of the processing of Personal Information.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through
                the Website and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such
                Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing
                Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may
                need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not
                be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used
                for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
                <li>Send administrative information</li>
                <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
                <li>Request user feedback</li>
                <li>Improve user experience</li>
                <li>Enforce terms and conditions and policies</li>
                <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
                <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
                <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-justify">Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where
                you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more
                specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for
                any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which
                you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us
                or by a third party. We may also combine or aggregate some of your Personal Information in order to better serve you and
                to improve and update our Website and Services.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be
                happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of
                Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-4">Disclosure of information</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">To maintain the highest level of privacy and to protect your Personal Information to the full extent,
                we do not share your Personal Information with any third parties.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">However, we may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or
                permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that
                disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond
                to a government request.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-5">Retention of information</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
                obligations, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or
                delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall
                be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability
                cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-6">Cookies</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">Our Website and Services use “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text
                file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to
                your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
                cookie to you. You may learn more about cookies and how they work in this guide.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for security and personalization, and for
                statistical purposes. Please note that you have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
                accept cookies by default, but you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-7">Do Not Track signals</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not
                want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with
                a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use
                or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do
                Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to
                Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit
                our use and collection of your Personal Information.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-8">Push notifications</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">We offer push notifications to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. To make sure push
                notifications reach the correct devices, we rely on a device token unique to your device which is issued by the operating system
                of your device. While it is possible to access a list of device tokens, they will not reveal your identity, your unique device
                ID, or your contact information to us. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and
                regulations. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push notifications, simply adjust your device settings accordingly.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-9">Links to other resources</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us.
                Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
                encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every
                resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-10">Information security</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected
                from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
                in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our
                control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are
                security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy
                of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii)
                any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-11">Data breach</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or
                Users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including,
                but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including,
                but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement
                authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe
                that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law.
                When we do, we will send you an email.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-12">Changes and amendments</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at any
                time at our discretion. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of the Website. We may also provide
                notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised
                Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised
                Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not,
                without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time
                your Personal Information was collected.</p>

            <h6 class="text-bold" id="section-13">Acceptance of this policy</h6>
            <p class="text-justify">You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By
                accessing and using the Website and Services and submitting your information you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you
                do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Website and Services.</p>
