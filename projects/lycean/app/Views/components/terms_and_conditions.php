                directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental,
                special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue,
                sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business
                opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without limitation, contract, tort, warranty,
                breach of statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility of
                such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate
                liability of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the
                services will be limited to an amount no greater than one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to the
                Operator for the prior one-month period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The
                limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its

                necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of
                any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
                jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their
                agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain
                in full force and effect.</p>
